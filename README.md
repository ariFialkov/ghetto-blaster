# Ghetto Blaster

> **Toy reskin.** This fork restyles the game as plastic street-crew toy figures fighting across miniature
> playset dioramas on a table: generated 3D figures, guns, props and streak units, a procedural playset building
> kit, miniature-painted textures, cap-gun effects and a plastic UI. Gameplay is unchanged: colliders, random draws
> and the Director's planned outcomes are identical to the original (`node scripts/sim-match.mjs tdm 4` and
> `node scripts/smoke-map.mjs <map>` check it).
> Reskin by thomasmodco ([fork](https://github.com/thomasmodco/ghetto-blaster)), merged into this repository.
> `npm run build` packs the `.glb` models into `models/pack.json` so the build contains no `.glb` files (some hosts
> refuse them); `npm run build:glb` keeps the individual `.glb` files instead.

A hood-themed first-person shooter that runs in the browser on desktop and mobile as a PWA.
Seven maps based on real cities, three modes (Team Deathmatch, Free For All, Gun Game),
five stock loadouts plus three custom slots, and 15 score streaks per map.

The multiplayer is **simulated**: every opponent and teammate is a bot, and the result of each
match is decided before it starts. The in-game Director steers the simulation toward that
result through bot strength, rigged duels and off-screen kills, so the match still plays
like a real, competitive game. Bet on yourself before the match; payouts follow the
pre-rolled outcome.

## Run it

```
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
npm run build      # static build in dist/ (PWA ready)
npm run preview
```

Install it as an app from the browser menu ("Add to Home Screen" on mobile). Play in landscape.

## Controls

Desktop: WASD move, mouse look, LMB fire, RMB aim, Shift sprint, Space jump, C duck (double-tap C to go prone, C while sprinting to slide),
Q/E peek, 1/2/scroll swap, R reload, G lethal, F tactical, 3/4/5 streaks, Tab scoreboard, L loadout (pre-game).

Controller (PS5 DualSense or Xbox, plug in or pair over Bluetooth, then press any button): left stick move, right stick look,
R2/RT fire, L2/LT aim, L3/LS sprint, ✕/A jump, ○/B duck (double-tap for prone, while sprinting to slide), □/X reload, △/Y switch weapon, R1/RB lethal, L1/LB tactical,
hold R3/RS to peek, D-pad ◀ ▲ ▶ streaks, D-pad ▼ loadout, Options/Menu pause, hold Create/View for the scoreboard.
Every menu is navigable with the D-pad or left stick. Aim assist (slowdown plus ADS snap) and vibration can be toggled in settings.

Mobile: left joystick (push to the edge to sprint), drag the right side to look, big red button to fire
(drag it to aim while firing), plus ADS / JUMP / DUCK / PEEK / SWAP / RLD / LETHAL / TAC buttons.

## Asset catalog

A live catalog of every character, weapon, piece of equipment, prop, structure, map, texture, VFX and icon is
built alongside the game at `asset-catalog/` (on GitHub Pages: `/ghetto-blaster/asset-catalog/`). Each entry is
rendered from the game's own code, with size, triangle and material counts, colour palette, per-map usage, reskin
notes and source location. Search, filter by category, sort by name / size / triangles / usage, switch to a table,
open any asset in a 3D viewer, and export everything as CSV or JSON.

## Headless tools

```
node scripts/smoke-map.mjs <mapId>      # validates a map: colliders, nav reachability, spawns
node scripts/sim-match.mjs tdm 10       # simulates full matches and checks the Director lands the plan
node scripts/sim-match.mjs ffa 10 kowloon
```

Add `?t=60` to the URL to shorten match time limits while testing.
